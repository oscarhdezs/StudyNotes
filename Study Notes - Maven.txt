maven
	Maven is a project management and comprehension tool that provides developers a complete build lifecycle framework.
	POM stands for Project Object Model.
	The POM contains information about the project and various configuration detail used by Maven to build the project(s).
	All POM files require the project element and three mandatory fields: groupId, artifactId, version.
	Projects notation in repository is groupId:artifactId:version.
	
	What is Build Lifecycle?
		A Build Lifecycle is a well-defined sequence of phases, which define the order in which the goals are to be executed.
		
	Phase								Handles								Description
prepare-resources					resource copying			Resource copying can be customized in this phase.
validate						Validating the information		Validates if the project is correct and if all necessary information is available.
compile									compilation				Source code compilation is done in this phase.
Test									Testing					Tests the compiled source code suitable for testing framework.
package									packaging				This phase creates the JAR/WAR package as mentioned in the packaging in POM.xml.
install									installation			This phase installs the package in local/remote maven repository.
Deploy									Deploying				Copies the final package to the remote repository.

Creating mvn project
	mvn archetype:generate
	-DgroupId = com.companyname.bank 
	-DartifactId = consumerBanking 
	-DarchetypeArtifactId = maven-archetype-quickstart 
	-DinteractiveMode = false
	
Build and test project
	mvn clean package
	
External dependecy
	in POM.xml
	<dependency>
         <groupId>ldapjdk</groupId>
         <artifactId>ldapjdk</artifactId>
         <scope>system</scope>
         <version>1.0</version>
         <systemPath>${basedir}\src\lib\ldapjdk.jar</systemPath>
      </dependency>
   </dependencies>
	
	External dependencies (library jar location) can be configured in pom.xml in same way as other dependencies.
		Specify groupId same as the name of the library.
		Specify artifactId same as the name of the library.
		Specify scope as system.
		Specify system path relative to the project location.
